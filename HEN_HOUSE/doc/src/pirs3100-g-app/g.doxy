\section g_intro Introduction

The `EGSnrc` application `g` was developed by Iwan Kawrakow in the late 90's and released as part of EGSnrc in 2004. It has since then been maintained by the EGSnrc Monte Carlo group at the NRC.
This application calculates \g, the average kinetic energy fraction lost 
to radiative events for photon beams (radiative loss fraction) or the radiative yield Y in the 
case of charged particle  beams. For photons, quantities such as kerma, \f$\textrm{K}\f$, collision kerma, \f$\textrm{K}_\mathrm{col}\f$, energy-fluence-averaged mass energy-transfer coefficient, \f$\overline{\mu}_\mathrm{tr}/\rho\f$, 
and mass energy-absorption coefficient, \f$\overline{\mu}_\mathrm{en}/\rho\f$, are also calculated.

Version 1.0 was released in January 2000 for the calculation of the average radiative 
fraction \f$\overline{g}\f$ or the raditaive yield Y. Later on, in March 2002, the 
code was extended to compute total and collision kerma (version 1.1). In the summer of 2002 the
calculation of average mass-energy transfer and absorption coefficients was added (version 1.2) and a bug to properly account for fluorescent photons corrected (version 1.3).
The \f$\overline{g}\f$ value used during the 2003 update of the Canadian Co-60 
air kerma primary standard was calculated with this code.

Motivated by the need to generate databases of mass-energy aborption coefficients for `EGSnrc` applications that allow calculating collision kerma, a photon-beam-only calculation (calculation type = 1) was implemented in April 2006. With this calculation type the efficiency of \muen 
calculations is increased significantly. For instance, an efficiency increase of about a factor 
of 70 is obtained for a 600 keV calculation in air. At around the same time, the ability to run the calculation for more than one energy on a linear or a logarithmic energy grid was added.
Since the code calculates \muen_rho and \mutr_rho values, databases for calculating collision and total kerma can be generated.

In January 2017, version 1.4 introduced refinements to the `AUSGAB` routine which combined
with several changes in `EGSnrc` allow proper classification of sub-threshold events as either \a radiative 
or \a non-radiative during atomic relaxations following photoeffect, Compton scattering, and electron impact 
ionization (EII). According to this scheme, 
sub-threshold relaxation Auger electrons following photoeffect or Compton scattering are added to 
the kerma calculation (non-radiative) and sub-threshold relaxation fluorescent photons after EII are 
included as part of the energy lost to radiative events. 

Current version (1.5) fixes a bug in the calculation of \g for both calculation types when the photon's 
energy is sampled from an energy spectrum. An exhaustive discussion of these issues can be found in the 
detailed paper by Rogers and Townson ([Med. Phys. 46 2019](https://doi.org/10.1002/mp.13744)).
It also provides a cleaner output and an option for more verbose output.

\section g_method Calculation method

\subsection g_charged Radiation yield

Radiation yield Y(\T0) of a charged particle is defined as the fraction of its initial kinetic energy \T0 emitted 
as electromagnetic radiation through the slowing down process of that particle in a medium. For light charged 
particles, bremsstrahlung, fluorescence after impact ionization and in-flight annihilation (in the case of positrons) 
are the interactions responsible for the emission of electromagnetic radiation. 

For the calculation of Y, the \c g application follows a number of charged particles with energy \T0 starting from the origin (0,0,0) 
with initial direction along the positive z-axis (0,0,1) as they travel across an infinite geometry filled with a user-defined medium. 
\Erad, the average energy radiated by these particles as they slow down in the medium is scored to compute Y using the expression

\f{equation}{
     Y = \frac{\overline{E}_\mathrm{rad}}{T_0}.
\f}

In adition to Y, the application also outputs \f$Y_\mathrm{brems}\f$, the radiative yield due to bremsstrahlung events to assess 
the approximation incurred when ignoring all other interactions as has been customarily done in the past.

\subsection g_photons Radiative fraction, mass energy transfer and absorption coefficients

A derivation of the equations used in the `g` application for the calculation of several physical quantities for photon beams is presented here. Expressions for monoenergetic beams are first derived followed by a generalization to polyenergetic sources. Most of these definitions can be found in basic radiation physics textbooks, hence users more interested with practical aspects of using the code can skip to the next section \ref g_calc_types. A summary at the end of the section details the equations used in `g` to calculate the different quantities for a given calculation type.

\subsubsection mono Monoenergetic beams

The mass energy transfer coefficient, \mutr_rho for a monoenegetic photon beam of energy E can be calculated using 

\f{equation}{\label{def_mutr}
     \left(\frac{\mu_\mathrm{tr}}{\rho}\right) = \frac{\overline{E}_\mathrm{tr}}{E} \cdot \left(\frac{\mu}{\rho}\right),
\f}

which follows from the [definition](https://physics.nist.gov/PhysRefData/XrayMassCoef/chap3.html) of \mutr_rho, 
and where \Etr is the average photon energy transferred to charged particles after photon interactions (photoelectric, 
Compton, and pair production), and \murho is the mass attenuation coefficient for a photon of energy E. 

The mass energy absorption coefficient for photons of energy E, \muen_rho, is defined as the non-radiative part of \mutr_rho and can be calculated using the expression

\f{equation}{\label{def_mutr}
     \left(\frac{\mu_\mathrm{en}}{\rho}\right) = 
     \left(1-\overline{g}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{\mu_\mathrm{tr}}{\rho}\right) =
	 \frac{\overline{E}_\mathrm{ab}}{E} \cdot \left(\frac{\mu}{\rho}\right),
\f}

where \Eab is the fraction of \Etr absorbed in the medium and \g the fraction of energy lost to
radiative events. 

\g is obtained as the ratio of \Etr to the average energy lost to radiative events as the electrons slow down in a medium, \EradP: 

\f{equation}{
     \overline{g} = \frac{\overline{\overline{E}}_\mathrm{rad}}{\overline{E}_\mathrm{tr}},
\f}

where

\f{equation}{
     \overline{\overline{E}}_\mathrm{rad} = \overline{E}_\mathrm{tr} - \overline{E}_\mathrm{ab}.
\f}

The estimation of \EradP follows the approach used above for\Erad to obtain radiation yield Y, however averaging is over all secondary charged particles.

Once the coefficients are known, kerma per unit fluence is obtained as

\f{equation}{
     \frac{K}{\phi} = E \cdot \left(\mu_\mathrm{tr}/\rho\right), 
\f}

and similarly, collision kerma per unit fluence is given by

\f{equation}{
     \frac{K_\mathrm{col}}{\phi} = E \cdot \left(\mu_\mathrm{en}/\rho\right). 
\f}

\subsubsection poly Polyenergetic beams

In the case of a polyenergetic source of photons, the definition of \g follows from the defintion of kerma and collision kerma. Kerma per unit fluence is defined by

\f{equation}{
     \frac{K}{\phi} = \int \phi(E) \cdot E \cdot \left(\frac{\mu_\mathrm{tr}(E)}{\rho}\right) \cdot dE/\int \phi(E) \cdot dE.
\f}

The right-hand side can be interpreted as the energy fluence weighted average of \mutr_rho times 
the fluence averaged spectrum energy or equivalently, as the fluence weighted average of the product of photon energy E and \mutr_rho:

\f{equation}{
     \frac{K}{\phi} = \left<\mu_\mathrm{tr}/\rho\right>_{\psi} \cdot \left<E\right>
	                = \left<E\cdot\mu_\mathrm{tr}/\rho\right>_{\phi}.
\f}

Similarly, collision kerma per unit fluence is given by

\f{equation}{
     \frac{K_\mathrm{col}}{\phi} = \left<\mu_\mathrm{en}/\rho\right>_{\psi} \cdot \left<E\right>
	                             = \left<E\cdot\mu_\mathrm{en}/\rho\right>_{\phi}.
\f}

Eqs. (9) and (10) are generalizations of Eqs. (6) and (7) for polyenergetic sources. As in the case of monoenergetic beams, collision kerma and kerma are linked via the relationship

\f{equation}{
     \frac{K_\mathrm{col}}{\phi} = \left(1-\overline{g}\right) \frac{K}{\phi} 
	  = \left(1-\overline{g}\right) \left<E\cdot\mu_\mathrm{tr}/\rho\right>_{\phi},
\f}

thus defining \g as the fraction of energy transferred by all photons to electrons, lost to radiative events. With this definition the expression for \g becomes

\f{equation}{
     \overline{g} = 1 - \frac{\left<E\cdot\mu_\mathrm{en}\right>_{\phi}}{\left<E\cdot\mu_\mathrm{tr}\right>_{\phi}},
\f}

which from Eqs. (2), (3) and (5) is equivalent to

\f{equation}{
  \overline{g} = 1 - \frac{\left<\overline{E}_\mathrm{en}\cdot\mu\right>_{\phi}}{\left<\overline{E}_\mathrm{tr}\cdot\mu\right>_{\phi}} = \frac{\left<\overline{\overline{E}}_\mathrm{rad}\cdot\mu\right>_{\phi}}{\left<\overline{E}_\mathrm{tr}\cdot\mu\right>_{\phi}}.i
\label{eq_muen_1}  
\f}

Eq. (13) generalizes the expression for \g obtained in the monoenergetic case (Eq. 6) and is the expression used to compute \g in the `g` application.

The energy fluence weighted average \f$\left<\mu_\mathrm{tr}/\rho\right>_{\psi}\f$ is computed using the expression

\f{equation}{
     \left<\mu_\mathrm{tr}/\rho\right>_{\psi} = 
	 \frac{\left<E\cdot\mu_\mathrm{tr}/\rho\right>_{\phi}}{\left<E\right>} =
	 \frac{\left<\overline{E}_\mathrm{tr}\cdot\mu\right>_{\phi}}{\left<E\right>},
\f}

and the energy fluence weighted average \f$\left<\mu_\mathrm{en}/\rho\right>_{\psi}\f$ with

\f{equation}{
     \left<\mu_\mathrm{en}/\rho\right>_{\psi} = 
	 \frac{\left<E\cdot\mu_\mathrm{en}/\rho\right>_{\phi}}{\left<E\right>} =
	 \frac{\left<\overline{E}_\mathrm{en}\cdot\mu\right>_{\phi}}{\left<E\right>},
\f}

or alternatively using

\f{equation}{
     \left<\mu_\mathrm{en}/\rho\right>_{\psi} = \left(1-\overline{g}\right)
	 \left<\mu_\mathrm{tr}/\rho\right>_{\psi},
\f}

from which kerma and collision kerma per unit fluence are calculated using Eqs. (9) and (11)
respectively. 

\subsubsection g_scoring Scoring algorithm for photon sources

- Initial photons forced to interact at the origin of an infinite geometry filled with a user-defined medium. 
- The photon energy transferred to charged particles after these interactions is scored to estimate \Etr. 
- After atomic relaxations only energy transferred to charged particles (Auger or Coster-Kronig) 
is scored as part of \Etr.
- Atomic relaxation events after electron impact ionization (EII), leading to fluoresence are classified as part of the radiative loss.
- Primary photons are killed after interacting in the medium 
- Radiative photons (bremsstrahlung, annihilation photons, fluorescent photons after EII) are immediately discarded after their energy is scored as part of \Erad. 
- Electrons are followed as they slow down in the medium until their energy falls below the transport cut-off energy ECUT. 
- Especial attention is paid to sub-threshold relaxation particles: 
   - Energy of sub-threshold Auger electrons after Compton or photoeffect is scored as part of \Etr. 
   - Energy of sub-threshold fluorescent photons after EII are scored as part of \Erad.

\note Although this app uses the variable g to refer indistinctively to both the radiative yield for charged particles, Y, 
and the radiative fraction for photons, g, these quantities are conceptually different. Radiative yield is defined as the 
fraction of a charged particle's kinetic energy lost to radiation as it slows down in a medium, while radiative fraction is defined 
as the average fraction of a photon's kinetic energy transferred to charged particles and subsequently lost to radiation as these charged 
particles slow down in the medium. The radiative fraction \g can be obtained from the integration of Y(E) over the secondary electron spectrum.

\section g_calc_types Calculation types

In its default implementation, the \c g code loops over a fixed number of histories
for a source of \a photons or <em>charged particles</em>. This calculation can be explicitely requested by setting the `calculation type` input to 0. A `calculation type` 1, for use with photon sources only, is taylored to the efficient calculation of the mass energy absorption coefficient \muen. In this mode the `g` application takes advantage of the faster convergence of \mutr and 1-\g  (when \g is small) to a desired accuracy and collision kerma is calculated with Eq.(11) and the mass energy absorption coefficient \muen is calculated using Eq.(16).
The calculation finishes as soon as a prescribed relative uncertainty \c accu is reached if provided by the user (\c accu > 0), else the calculation runs until all histories completed.

The inputs for a `calculation type` can be anywhere in the input file and do not require to 
be placed between delimiters as is customary in most EGSnrc applications. An example of a calculation type 1 input block that should run until a 0.01% accuracy is reached, or
all histories are completed, is shown in the following code snippet:

\code
  ####################################################################
  # calculation types

  # 0 (default)            : Executes fixed number of histories
  #
  # 1 (photon source only) : Runs to desired accuracy or total number 
  #                          of histories if no accuracy specified or
  #                          number of histories not large enough. 
  #####################################################################

  # energy losses. Only relevant for type 1 calculations.

  ####################################################################
  verbose = yes
  #############
\endcode

\note If the number of histories is not large enough, the calculation will finish without reaching a desired accuracy.

\section g_spec Source definition

The input block for definiting source parameters must be placed between `start` and `stop`
delimiters. For instance, to define a monoenergetic source emitting particles of energy \f$E\f$, 
and charge \f$q\f$, the input keys required are:

\code
 :Start Source Input:

  Incident Charge         = q # 0 for photons -1 or 1 for e- or e+
  INCIDENT SPECTRUM       = mono-energy
  INCIDENT KINETIC ENERGY = E

:Stop Source Input:
\endcode

Several individual energies can be requested by adding comma separated
energy values:

\code
 :Start Source Input:

  Incident Charge         = q # 0 for photons -1 or 1 for e- or e+
  INCIDENT SPECTRUM       = mono-energy
  INCIDENT KINETIC ENERGY = E1,...,EN

:Stop Source Input:
\endcode

In this case the code will loop over individual calculations for each energy.

To generate a database of \mutr or \muen values as function of energy, one can define a linear or 
a logarithmic energy grid. A linear (equidistant) energy grid is defined using the input keys

\code
 :Start Source Input:

  Incident Charge         = q # 0 for photons -1 or 1 for e- or e+
  INCIDENT SPECTRUM       = mono-energy-lin-range
  INCIDENT KINETIC ENERGY = Emin, Emax, DE

:Stop Source Input:
\endcode

where the input key `DE` defines the bin width \f$\Delta\mathrm{E}\f$ defining a grid of energies: 
\f$E_\mathrm{min}, ..., E_\mathrm{min} + i \cdot \Delta\mathrm{E}, ..., E_\mathrm{max}\f$

Similarly, a logarithmic energy grid is defined using the input keys

\code
 :Start Source Input:

 INCIDENT SPECTRUM=       mono-energy-log-range
 INCIDENT KINETIC ENERGY= Emin, Emax, N

:Stop Source Input:
\endcode

the logarithmic bin width \f$\Delta_\mathrm{log}\f$ is obtained using

\f{equation}{
  \Delta_\mathrm{log} = log\left(\frac{E_\mathrm{max}}{E_\mathrm{min}}\right)/\left(N-1\right)
\f}

defining a logarithmic grid of N energy values 

\f{equation}{
  E_i = e^{log(E_\mathrm{min})+i \cdot \Delta_\mathrm{log}}
\f}

These calculations will be limited to one CPU thread since there is no parallel execution capability in `g`. As the energy increases, CPU time will also increase. If a computer cluster or multiprocessor PC is available, it is more efficient to perform these calculations individually
by submitting them to the available CPU threads. 

\note A strategy for creating large \muen databases is described below in section \ref g_databases.

Source of particles with a tabulated energy distribution (spectrum) can also be defined. A polyenergetic Co-60 beam is defined using the keys:

\section g_usage Usage
The `EGSnrc` application \c g can be started from the command line
using
\code
g -i input_file [-p pegs_file] [-o output_file] [-b]
\endcode
where the arguments in square brackets are optional. If material information is 
obtained via a PEGS4 data file, the option <b>\c -p</b>  tells the application
which file to use. Alternatively, materials can be defined in the input file via 
a media definition input block, in which case this option must be ommited.
With the <b>\c -o</b> option one can change the name of the output files 
(by default <b>\c input_file.xxx</b>
is used, where <b>\c xxx</b> is <b>\c .egslog</b> for the log file, <b>\c .egsdat</b> for the
data file, etc.). With <b>\c -b</b> one specifies a "batch" run, \em i.e. the
output is redirected to <b>\c output_file.egslog</b>. 
Remember that any application can be executed from the `EGSnrc` GUI \c egs_gui.

\section g_databases Building large databases

The mechanism for parallel execution is not available in the \c g app. As a consequence, 
lengthy calculations cannot be run on multiple cores for instance on a computer cluster. 
This limitation makes the creation of large databases spaning an energy range from threshold
up to several MeVs very time consuming. As the energy of the photon increases, more energetic electrons are created which have to be followed throughout an infinite geometry until they have lost all their kinetic energy.

Any of the possible options for source energy definition as an energy grid ties up the calculation to only one CPU core while most machines today offer several cores that could be put to good use. It is hence more practical to create individual input files for either energy groups (low energies) or for each energy, and submit individual calculations. Furhtermore, one can take advantage of the energy dependence of the mass energy transfer and absorption coefficients and use a logarithmic energy grid to reduce the number of high energy data points.

A recipe for creating a database of 2000 \muen or \mutr values on a logarithmic energy grid
from 1 keV up to 1.5 MeV is presented:

<ul>
<li> Create an input file for the material of interest \c air0o and a logarithmic energy grid
